Deep Learning Models to find the composers of the Music. The models are trained with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to identify the composers of the given music files in .mid format.

# Musical Data Analysis

Music is a form of art that is ubiquitous and has a rich history. Different composers have created music with their unique styles and compositions. However, identifying the composer of a particular piece of music can be a challenging task, especially for novice musicians or listeners. The proposed project aims to use deep learning techniques to identify the composer of a given piece of music accurately.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a given musical score accurately. The project aims to accomplish this objective by using two deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

### Data set

The project will use a dataset consisting of musical scores from various composers. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle web store https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blanderbuss/midi-classic-music?resource=download

The dataset contains the midi files of compositions from well-known classical composers like Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart. The dataset should be labeled with the name of the composer for each score.

Analysis is done on .mid files only for below composers.

1-Bach
2-Beethoven
3-Chopin
4-Mozart
